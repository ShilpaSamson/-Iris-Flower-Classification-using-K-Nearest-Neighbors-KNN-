# -Iris-Flower-Classification-using-K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-
This project uses the KNN algorithm to classify iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica using sepal and petal features. Steps included preprocessing, scaling, train-test split, and model training. Accuracy and confusion matrix evaluated performance. Visuals showed feature distribution and K optimization.
